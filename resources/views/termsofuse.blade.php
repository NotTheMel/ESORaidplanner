                            The Operators reserve the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time
                            without prior notice to User. Your use of the Website following any such change constitutes

                            and re-export of commodities or technical data.<br><br>

                            You may not upload or transmit any material that infringes or misappropriates any person's
                            copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the the Website any
                            information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality
                            obligations you may have.<br><br>

                            You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer
                            code, nor subject the Website's network or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or
                            otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the
                            Website.<br><br>

                            You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Website any unlawful,
                            harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,
                            profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise
                            objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that
                            encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability,
                            or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.<br><br>

                            You are expressly prohibited from compiling and using other Users' personal information,
                            including addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses or other contact
                            information that may appear on the Website, for the purpose of creating or compiling
                            marketing and/or mailing lists and from sending other Users unsolicited marketing materials,
                            whether by facsimile, email, or other technological means.<br><br>

                            You also are expressly prohibited from distributing Users' personal information to
                            third-party parties for marketing purposes. The Operators shall deem the compiling of
                            marketing and mailing lists using Users' personal information, the sending of unsolicited
                            marketing materials to Users, or the distribution of Users' personal information to third
                            parties for marketing purposes as a material breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use,
                            and the Operators reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the
                            Website and to suspend or revoke your membership in the consortium without refund of any
                            membership dues paid.<br><br>

                            The Operators note that unauthorized use of Users' personal information in connection with
                            unsolicited marketing correspondence also may constitute violations of various state and
                            federal anti-spam statutes. The Operators reserve the right to report the abuse of Users'
                            personal information to the appropriate law enforcement and government authorities, and the
                            Operators will fully cooperate with any authorities investigating violations of these laws.

                            <h4>User Submissions</h4>

                            The Operators do not want to receive confidential or proprietary information from you
                            through the Website. Any material, information, or other communication you transmit or post
                            ("Contributions") to the Website will be considered non-confidential.<br><br>

                            All contributions to this site are licensed by you under the MIT License to anyone who
                            wishes to use them, including the Operators.<br><br>

                            If you work for a company or at a University, it's likely that you're not the copyright
                            holder of anything you make, even in your free time. Before making contributions to this
                            site, get written permission from your employer.

                            <h4>User Discussion Lists and Forums</h4>

                            The Operators may, but are not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Website
                            where users transmit or post communications or communicate solely with each other, including
                            but not limited to user forums and email lists, and the content of any such communications.
                            The Operators, however, will have no liability related to the content of any such
                            communications, whether or not arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy,
                            obscenity, or otherwise. The Operators may edit or remove content on the the Website at
                            their discretion at any time.

                            <h4>Indemnification</h4>

                            You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Operators, agents, vendors or suppliers
                            from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable
                            attorneys' fees, arising from or related to your use or misuse of the Website, including,
                            without limitation, your violation of these Terms and Conditions, the infringement by you,
                            or any other subscriber or user of your account, of any intellectual property right or other
                            right of any person or entity.

                            <h4>Termination</h4>

                            These Terms and Conditions of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no
                            longer agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you must cease use of the Website.
                            If you are dissatisfied with the Website, their content, or any of these terms, conditions,
                            and policies, your sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Website. The Operators
                            reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Website, or parts of
                            the Website, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use (i) is in
                            violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests,
                            including intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where
                            the Operators have reason to believe that you are in violation of these Terms and Conditions
                            of Use.

                            <h4>Links to Other Materials</h4>

                            The Website may contain links to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These
                            links are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such sites
                            and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites. The fact that
                            the Operators offer such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement,
                            authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products
                            referenced therein, and the Operators reserve the right to note its lack of affiliation,
                            sponsorship, or endorsement on the Website. If you decide to access any of the third party
                            sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites
                            employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that
                            may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held responsible for the
                            accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party
                            sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.
