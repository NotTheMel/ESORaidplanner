                        <p>It seems the account you are trying to connect is either not a patron of <a
                                    href="https://patreon.com/Woeler" target="_blank">Woeler</a> or it has caused an
                            error. If you are sure you are logged into the correct account and you are pledged to
                            Woeler. Please contact Woeler via Discord or Patreon.</p>
